# Wizard-Ani
Overall Assignment goal was to pull information from an API and use it to do something useful to the user. 

Developed using the following API:
https://api.jikan.moe/v4/anime

Techonlogies used: Javascript, JQuery, API, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS.
Deployed to Netlify at: https://wizard-ani.netlify.app/

Final version has a carousel of images that updates initially to 25 animes. There is a search bar at the top with radio buttons to allow different kinds of searches. When the user searches with the tools provided it updates the animes in the carousel. Pushing the scrolling button at the bottom of the page opens a Modal that displays detailed information about the current Anime displayed on the carousel in a card format with links to external trailer and websites if available through the API. Spent some time working with sizing and styling to make it useable when browsed by a phone screen.
