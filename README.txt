Assignment to use API's to pull current Anime information

Planning to develop using the following API's:
https://api.jikan.moe/v4/anime
https://api.jikan.moe/v4/anime/{id}
pared back design to a carousel of animes from jikan api. The other API's did not have 
good content, or returned it in XML format. I wasn't sure if I would be able to figure 
out how to parse XML within the time constraints of this assignment. I then added on the 
ability for the user to push a button on the carousel. The button will open a full screen
modal that gives details about the Anime selected, and links to the trailer and links to 
other sites with more information about the anime.
