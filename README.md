# Wizard-Ani
Homebrew project to use API's to pull current Anime information

Planning to develop using the following API's:
https://jikan.moe/

https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/api.php

https://chandan-02.github.io/anime-facts-rest-api/

Initial design idea is a scrolling news bar across the top of page, with search options below. Search should return cards(bootstrap) matching the name search as well as a scrolling modal that brings up quotes from the specific card. This should utilize all three API's as well as some bootstrap to style.
